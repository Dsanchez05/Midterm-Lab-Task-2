# Midterm Lab Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Preparation using Excel
In this activity, we cleaned an excel sheet fill of errors and redundancy using different excel features.
# Step 1 Data Cleaning and Transformation Using Power Query Editor
- Download the copy of the raw dataset (Uncleaned_DS_jobs.csv) 
- Load the Data in Excel – Open Excel – Goto Data – New Query Open File – text/csv
- Load – Edit the Dataset using Power Query Editor
- Duplicate the raw data

- Create 2 New Columns (From the Salary Estimate) Min Sal and Max Sal
- ADD COLUMN – Role Type 
- SPLIT COLUMNS by Delimeter 
- Select Location column (SPLIT columns by , Delimeter)
- Copy the APPLIED steps as proof of your Data Cleaning Activities ->

# Step 2 Reshape and Group the tables
- Create a duplicate of the raw data Right Click Unclean DS Jobs select 
duplicate (Queries pane) 
- Rename the duplicate with “Sal By Role Type dup”
- Rename the reference with “Sal By Role Size ref”
- Mapping Other Files and include in the current queries
- Rename the reference with “Sal By State ref”
- To view dependencies and References of the QUERIES
